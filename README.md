# Semantic_Version_Webpage
Semantic Version Webpage Using HTML & CSS

Convert your webpage into a semantic version.
Add accessibility improvements:
Add alt text to all images.
Use <label> tags in forms.
Ensure proper heading levels (<h1> to <h3>).
Try navigating the page using keyboard only (Tab and Enter).
Bonus: Read about ARIA roles and experiment with role="button" or role="navigation" on non-semantic elements.
